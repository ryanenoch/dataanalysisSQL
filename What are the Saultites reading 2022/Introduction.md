### Introduction
SooToday published a list of the top 25 most circulated books of 2022 compiled by the Sault Ste. Marie Library. Apparently, the article implies that the locals mostly read books made by David Baldacci. To confirm, an analysis will be done on the list of most circulated books

The analysis will be done using JupySQL running DuckDB SQL RDBMS and the results will be visualized as a bar chart using Matplotlib and Seaborn. A bit of Python code will be used just to convert the query results to a dataframe form readable by Matplotlib and Seaborn
